# Lensed_Galaxy_Reconstructions
 Following the methods outlined by James W Nightingale and his team, we attempt to use the 'autolens' Python workspace to reconstruct galaxies based on image data. It will be performed by ray tracing galaxies that exhibit strong gravitational lensing, then searching through parameter space with to find the best fit of physical parameters.

The main code, outputs, and image data can be found in the autolens_workspace folder.

The report summary can be found in pdf form under "Galaxy Structure with Gravitational Lensing.pdf".
