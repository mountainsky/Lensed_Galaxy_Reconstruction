# Lensed_Galaxy_Reconstructions
Following the methods of James W Nightingale and his team, we attempt to use the 'autolens'  workspace from https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoLens to reconstruct galaxies based on image data. It will be performed by ray tracing galaxies that exhibit strong gravitational lensing, then searching through parameter space to model physical attributes.

The main code, outputs, and image data can be found in the autolens_workspace folder.

The report summary can be found in pdf form under "Galaxy Structure with Gravitational Lensing.pdf".
